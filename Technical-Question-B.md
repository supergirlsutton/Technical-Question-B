# Technical-Question-B

Estimated completion time: 0.5-2h
Directions: Using the Twitter API, write code to retrieve the 50 most recent Tweets that contain at least one image or video of a pet (cat or dog). To be fair to both cat and dog people, you should exclude the hashtag #caturday. 

When done, make sure to share your code using a platform such as Github (either as a project or a Gist), Bitbucket or Glitch so it can be shared and discussed.

Things to keep in mind:
Write your code using any language or tool you’re most comfortable with 
You can use any of the standard Twitter API, or sandbox premium API (one or more) you think are relevant. You do not need to sign up for enterprise access, or for paid premium API access 
You can use any HTTP request library 
Make sure the code can run; if it’s helpful, add a README file with instructions to run the script. 
If your code uses any dependencies, make sure they can be retrieved using a dependency manager. For example, if you’re using Python, make sure to include a requirements.txt file; if you’re using JavaScript, make sure there’s a package.json file; if you’re using Ruby, make sure there’s a Gemfile; and so on).
